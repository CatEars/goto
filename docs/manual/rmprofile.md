# Rmprofile

### Tags

Advanced, Profile

### Usage

```bash
$ goto --rmprofile some_profile
```

### Effect

Will remove `some_profile` so that it is no longer usable.

### Notes

Rmprofile will remove a profile so think extra hard about wheter you want to
remove it or not before doing so!

Anything with profiles is considered advanced usage, because you normally don't
need to learn that much about it to use `goto`.
