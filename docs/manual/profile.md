# Profile

### Tags

Advanced, Profile

### Usage

```bash
$ goto --profile some_profile
```

### Effect

Will switch to using `some_profile`. This will (if not yet created) be a
completely blank profile. If you need to divide your teleportations into
different buckets, where you sometimes want to use teleportations from bucket #1
and sometimes use teleportations from bucket #2 then this is the command for
you! Every user starts out with the `default` profile, which can never be
removed, so profiles is just a way to namespace your teleports.

### Notes

Anything with profiles is considered advanced usage, because you normally don't
need to learn that much about it to use `goto`.
