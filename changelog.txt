Version 0.1.1 - First Public PyPI Release (beta)

First public release of goto.

The basic functionality is there with --add,--list,--remove,--profile,--profiles
and bash completion. The coverage of the code is rather meager so far, but most
of the feature development for this cycle is finished and so we can focus on
testing and quality assurance.
