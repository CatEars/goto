# goto

ðŸ”– ðŸ”– ðŸ”– Bookmarks for the terminal ðŸ”– ðŸ”– ðŸ”–

The (very) tldr usage of `goto`:

1. Bookmark with `goto --add ./my_folder`
2. Use `cd` to go somewhere else
3. Run `goto my_folder` and you're back again

Usage gifs and usage documentation can be found in the
[docs folder](https://github.com/CatEars/goto/blob/master/docs/README.md)

## Key Features

* Like browser bookmarks, but for the commandline!
* Add commonly visited places, like `code/my_project` and teleport to it from anywhere!
* Did you say you want auto-completion with that? Of course there is auto-completion!
* Works with both zsh and bash!
* Got several folders with similar names? Use an alias for the bookmark!
