A command line tool for teleporting around your computer!

TODO: Add gif of how goto works

## Key Features

* Add commonly visited places, like `code/my_project` and teleport to it from anywhere!
* Did you say you want auto-completion with that? Of course there is auto-completion!
* Works with both zsh and bash!
* What if you want to call `my_project` "secret_project" instead? This is entirely possible!
* Do you want different auto completion at different times? We got profiles for that!

## Unnecessary slogan

Goto - The good way to program

## Installing

#### bash

```sh
pip install goto-cd
_gotohelper --install bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### zsh

```sh
pip install goto-cd
_gotohelper --install zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Help I get "Command not found!"

There is a slight chance you get the error message `_gotohelper: command not
found` when installing. This probably means that goto was installed correctly,
but your `PATH` variable needs to include where `_gotohelper` is located. With
newer versions of pip `_gotohelper` tends to be installed in `~/.local/bin` and
so you would add `export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin` to the end of your `.bashrc`
in bash and `.zshrc` in zsh.
