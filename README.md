ðŸ”– ðŸ”– ðŸ”– Bookmarks for the terminal ðŸ”– ðŸ”– ðŸ”–

The tldr usage of `goto`:

1. Bookmark with `goto --add ./my_folder`
2. Use `cd` to go somewhere else, or open a new terminal, or restart your computer
3. Run `goto my_folder` and you're teleported back to `my_folder`

Usage gifs and usage documentation can be found in the
[docs folder](https://github.com/CatEars/goto/blob/master/docs/README.md)

## Key Features

* Like browser bookmarks, but for the commandline!
* Add commonly visited places, like `code/my_project` and teleport to it from anywhere!
* Did you say you want auto-completion with that? Of course there is auto-completion!
* Works with bash, zsh and powershell!
* Got several folders with similar names? Use an alias for the bookmark!

## Unnecessary slogan

Goto - The good way to program

## Installing

## Basic Usage

Note: The installed binary is called `goto-cd`, but `goto` is the name of the command 
loaded into your shell. `goto-cd` is only referenced when installing the first time.

```sh
goto --add .
# Prints "Added 'catears' which points to '/home/catears'"
cd /
goto catears
# Ends up at /home/catears
```
