# goto

TODO: Badges

A Python command line tool for navigating your computer!

## Key Features

* Add commonly visited places, like `code/my_project` and teleport to it from anywhere!
* Did you say you want auto-completion with that? Of course there is auto-completion!
* Works with both zsh and bash!
* What if you want to call `my_project` "secret_project" instead? This is entirely possible!
* Do you want different auto completion at different times? We got profiles for that!
