# Contributing

Any contributions are welcome. As with any open source repo the rule is to be
sensible. Use Pull Requests to ask for changes to the code that you made, open
an issue for suggestions and issues/bugs. Do understand however that I have a
full time job and I can't fix everything. In other words, if you really really
really want something to happen I am afraid the best way is to do it yourself
(and then send a PR my way of course!). Below are some lists that should give an
idea of how to best contribute.

## Very Welcome Contributions

* Adaptations for other shells (I've heard `fish` is popular).
* Improvements for currently supported shells
* Tests (Unit tests, Tests formulated like user stories etc.)
* MacOS testing
* PRs that solve obvious bugs
* Documentation (More Pictures/Videos/Screencasts = More Better)
* Developer Documentation
* Issues with reproducible bugs
* Positive and Professional Discussions

## Quite Welcome Contributions

* Feature Suggestions
* Issues where minimal brain capacity is needed to reproduce bugs

## Kinda Welcome Contributions

* Windows Integration
* Issues with bugs that only say what went wrong

## Not So Welcome Contributions

* Big changes to the underlying code base
* Issues with bugs that is impossible to understand why they would be bugs and are 100% impossible to reproduce
* Angry and Unprofessional Discussions

## "Not even going to answer" level "Contributions"

* "Please hire me/Looking for a developer with X/Are you experienced in X?" LinkedIn posts disguised as Issues
